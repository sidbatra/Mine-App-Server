If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services, Site Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Site Content.<br /><br />
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE Site or ServiceS OR BY POSTING ANY MEMBER CONTENT ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE Site.

If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.<br /><br />

If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and the Services.<br /><br />

    <h3>How OnCloset Works</h3>
    After you have created an Account (defined below) to become a Member of OnCloset, you may use the Services to create and view virtual closets of items. In order to create a virtual closet, you may (i) select search engine images relevant to a search query initiated by you on the site, (ii) provide the URL of a page containing the item to be uploaded.

    In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Member Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account ("Account").
