		Pierre graduated in Information Design from the University of the Arts, London. 
		He worked in ad planning, political polling and media at WPP before moving to Stanford for his MBA. 
		Post-Stanford, he was Twitter's first PMM, working on Promoted Tweets, Accounts and Trends.
		He loves the challenge of building social products for web and mobile, so his luckiest break was teaming up Sid and Deepak to work on Mine.
