If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services, Site Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Site Content.<br /><br />
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE Site or ServiceS OR BY POSTING ANY MEMBER CONTENT ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE Site. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE Site, SERVICES OR SITE CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.<br /><br />

    <h3>Modification</h3>
    Denwen reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site or Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated Date" at the top of these Terms.

If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and the Services.<br /><br />

    <h3>How <%=CONFIG[:name]%> Works</h3>
    After you have created an Account (defined below) to become a Member of <%=CONFIG[:name]%>, you may use the Services to create and view virtual mines of items. In order to create a virtual mine, you may (i) select search engine images relevant to a search query initiated by you on the site, (ii) provide the URL of a page containing the item to be uploaded. Please note that your virtual mine will be publicly viewable by all visitors to the Site.<br /><br />

    <h3>Account Registration</h3>
    In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Member Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account ("Account"). You must register with <%=CONFIG[:name]%> through your account with Facebook. When you register through your Facebook account, you will be asked to login to the Services using your Facebook account credentials.

    You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Denwen reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password.
