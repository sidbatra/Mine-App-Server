	<h3>What is mine?</h3>
	<p>
		Mine is a simple service for sharing purchases with friends.<br />
		Whether it's for a specific recommendation or just plain curiosity, 
		people often want to learn from what their friends are buying. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>
		When you add a new purchase, friends you've invited will 
    see it in their feed of items when they log in.
		You can also share out more widely to your Facebook friends.
	</p>
